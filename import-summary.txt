ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* LICENSE.txt
* README.md
* init.lua
* interp.lua
* lua-license.txt
* org.keplerproject.luajava-license.txt
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => androLua\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => androLua\src\main\assets\
* jni\ => androLua\src\main\jni\
* libs\armeabi\libluajava.so => androLua\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi\libluajava.so
* res\ => androLua\src\main\res\
* src\ => androLua\src\main\java\
* src\org\keplerproject\org.keplerproject.luajava\package.html => androLua\src\main\resources\org\keplerproject\org.keplerproject.luajava\package.html

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
